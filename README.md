# To the Fullest

'To the Fullest' is a web application designed to make everyday a little less ordinary, and is my entry into the April 2022 Timathon.

You can see it in action [here](https://shannonnorris.co.uk/).

## Theme Interpretation

The theme for this Code Jam is **make everyday a little less ordinary**.

My interpretation of this theme, which led to the creation of various features, was that there are two ways to make everyday a little ordinary...
1. Altering small things about your day, just enough to add a little sparkle to make that day special. For example, you might dress a little bit differently, or go somewhere else for lunch that you don't usually go.
2. Going big with it and striving for a lifestyle change, which would change every single day in the build up to changing your future.
